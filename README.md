OLPS
====

OLPS is an open-source toolbox for On-Line Portfolio Selection, which includes a collection of on-line portofolio selection strategies implemented in Matlab/Octave.

QUICK START
===========

OLPS_gui.m 	run the OLPS toolbox in the Graphical User Interface (GUI)	(recommended, available only in Matlab)

OLPS_cli.m 	run the OLPS toolbox in the Command Line Interface (CLI)	(compatible for both Matlab and octave)

Please let us know how you use OLPS, and help us develop a better toolbox if possible. 

INSTALLATION
============

* Unzip and copy the whole OLPS directory you just downloaded in a location of your disk, e.g., /my-directory/

* Run Matlab/Ocatve, Go to /my-directory/OLPS/ at the command prompt

* run 'OLPS_gui' (Matlab) or 'OLPS_cli' (Ocatve)

  Let us know if there is any error when running the above. 

ENVIRONMENT SETUP
=================

The toolbox has been tested in Matlab 2012b (64-bit and 32-bit) under three major OS: Windows 7/8 (64-bit and 32-bit), Linux (Red-Hat Enterprise Linux) (64-bit and 32-bit) and Mac OS X. The toolbox is also compatable for Octave (version 3.8.0) in the command-line interface (CLI) under three major OS: Windows 7, Linux (64-bit and 32-bit), and Mac OS X.

DOCUMENTATIONS
